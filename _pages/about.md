Howdy! I'm a data scientist developing statistical and machine learning methods for problems in the physical sciences, particularly in astrophysics. I graduated from New College of Florida with a B.A. in Statistics & Applied Mathematics in 2022 and an M.S. in Applied Data Science in 2024. Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University while maintaining collaborations at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to better detect and model solar flares using satellite data. Previously, I have conducted research in the Exoplanets and Stellar Astrophysics Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and worked on the NASA Hubble Communications Team. Beyond my studies, I am passionate about STEM outreach, higher education policy, and creating a future that is both secure for AI developments and beneficial for society. I am also the founder and principal consultant of OutlierOrbit, a data science consulting and solutions company, and a member of the Board of Directors of the New College Foundation.
