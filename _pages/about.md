Howdy! I'm a data scientist developing statistical and machine learning methods for problems in the physical sciences. Currently, I'm pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html), conducting research in the CMU [Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences (STAMPS) Research Center](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/stamps/) on trustworthy AI for science with [Dr. Ann B. Lee](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~annlee/). I also maintain research collaborations at the [Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu) and [International CHASC Astro-Statistics Collaboration](https://hea-www.harvard.edu/astrostat/) where I am working to better detect and understand solar flares using statistical and machine learning methods. Previously, I have conducted research in the [Exoplanets and Stellar Astrophysics Laboratory](https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/astrophysics/exoplanets) at the [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=nasa+goddard&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and interned with the [NASA Hubble Communications Team](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/team/#mission-operations).

I am a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program) and Senior [Quad Fellow](https://www.quadfellowship.org), and I graduated from New College of Florida with a B.A. in Statistics & Applied Mathematics in 2022 and an M.S. in Applied Data Science in 2024. Beyond my studies, I am passionate about STEM outreach, higher education policy, and bridging scientific research to societal impact through technological and policy solutions. I am also the founder and principal consultant of [OutlierOrbit](https://outlierorbit.com), a data science consulting and solutions company, and a member of the Board of Directors of the [New College Foundation](https://www.ncf.edu/alumni/foundation/).
