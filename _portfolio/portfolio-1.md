The LF2I (Likelihood-Free Frequentist Inference) package is a comprehensive Python toolkit for performing statistical inference on simulator parameters when likelihood functions are intractable or unavailable. Developed by [Luca Masserano](https://github.com/lucamasserano) at STAMPS@CMU Reserach Center, this package addresses a fundamental challenge in modern scientific computing where complex simulators are used but traditional likelihood-based methods fail.
