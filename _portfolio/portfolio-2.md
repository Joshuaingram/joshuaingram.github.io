The TSI (Trustworthy Scientific Inference) package is an open-source Python implementation of the Frequentist-Bayes (FreB) protocol, developed alongside [James Carzon](https://github.com/JamesCarzon), [Luca Masserano](https://github.com/lucamasserano), [Alex Shen](https://github.com/Alex-Shen-CMU), and [Antonio Carlos Herling Ribeiro Junior](https://github.com/antonioherling) as part of collaborative research at CMU's STAMPS Research Center. This package addresses a critical challenge in modern scientific computing: while generative AI models excel at solving inverse problems across scientific disciplines, they often produce biased or overconfident regions of uncertainty.

The open-source repository can be found here: [GitHub](https://github.com/lee-group-cmu/tsi)
