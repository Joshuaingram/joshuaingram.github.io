The StarsML package addresses a fundamental challenge in modern astronomy: reliably cross-matching sources across different wavelength catalogs when traditional spatial-based methods fail. Developed by [Victor_Samuel Perez-Diaz](https://github.com/samuelperezdi) for the Chandra-Gaia Catalog of Counterparts project, this package implements machine learning algorithms that go beyond simple positional matching to incorporate intrinsic object properties like magnitudes, colors, and distances.
